# GravitySimulator

* Compute positions of gravitation bodies and simulate space missions.
* Simulate many-body gravitational acceleration.
* Simulate gravity effects on non-spherical shape (special case, not done for all bodies).
* Simulate space vehicles thrust and simulate missions.
* Define an object oriented interface to allow creation of systems (star, planets, etc).  These are all the same but stars also radiate.
